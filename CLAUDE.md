# CLAUDE.md

Rules for agents working in a competition repository created from
[waggle](https://github.com/mei28/waggle). The `kaggle-*` skills in
`~/.claude/skills` hold the procedures (onboard, validation, experiment, submit, retro); this file
holds what is always true here.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `input/<comp>/` | Competition data as Kaggle lays it out (gitignored) |
| `folds/` | Versioned fold files shared by all experiments (git-tracked, never overwritten) |
| `src/kgl/` | Shared modules: env, cv, metrics, features, registry, tracker, log, io |
| `experiments/expNNN_change/` | One experiment: `run.py` (train, OOF, metrics.json) and `infer.py` (submission) |
| `output/<exp>/<run>/` | Run artifacts: `metrics.json`, `config.json`, `oof.parquet`, `model/`, `run.log`, `submission.csv` |
| `notebooks/` | marimo `.py` notebooks (EDA); `.ipynb` files are export products |
| `docs/` | `competition.md`, `validation.md`, `experiments.md` (generated), `submissions.md`, `eda.md`, `retro.md` |
| `tools/` | Thin CLIs behind the justfile |

## Commands

`just --list` is the command surface. Use the recipes (`just run`, `just infer`, `just submit`,
`just exp-table`, `just record`) rather than calling Python or the Kaggle CLI directly, so every run
lands in `output/` with the same layout and the records stay complete.

## Decision gates

The user decides which experiment to run next, how validation is designed, whether a result is
accepted, and when to submit. Implement, run, record, and research without waiting, but stop at
those four points and present options unless the user has said to continue on their own.

## Phase guard

Compute the phase from the dates in `docs/competition.md`. If a request belongs to a later phase,
say which phase it belongs to and let the user decide; do not refuse.

| Phase | Time | Do | Not yet |
|---|---|---|---|
| Early | first 30% | EDA, fold design, one strong baseline, a submission pipeline that runs end to end | ensembling, TTA, heavy augmentation, hyperparameter search |
| Mid | 30-70% | 3-5 diverse single models, error analysis, data fixes, augmentation checks | full ensembling, wide hyperparameter search |
| Late | last 30% | ensembling, TTA, post-processing, final submission choice, shake-up estimate | new architectures, big preprocessing changes, new external data |

## Look at outputs before tuning

After a run, inspect at least 20 predictions against ground truth (worst and borderline cases),
group the errors, and propose changes that address a group. A proposal that only moves a
hyperparameter because "CV went down" is not enough.

## Recording

- `run.py` writes `metrics.json` the moment training finishes; never leave a finished run without it.
- After every full run: `just exp-table`, then `just record <exp> <issue>` on the idea's Issue.
- Submissions are recorded by `just submit ... --now` in `docs/submissions.md`; copy CV and LB into the
  CV vs LB table in `docs/validation.md`.
- One idea = one Issue (labels `idea`, `cv`, `data`, `bug`). Experiments are comments. Closing an Issue
  is the decision, and the user closes it.

## Code rules

- The Hard Rules of `~/.claude/AGENTS.md` apply: fail fast, no fallback code, no defensive code for
  cases that do not occur, no alternative implementation without asking.
- `src/kgl` and `tools/` follow the `tdd` skill: a failing test first, then the code. Run `just test`
  before proposing a commit.
- `experiments/` is exempt from TDD. Experiment scripts are hypotheses; their check is the CV score.
  They still fail fast: assert shapes and use `kgl.io.validate_submission`, and never swallow exceptions.
- Code that two experiments need moves into `src/kgl` with a test. Until then it stays in `run.py`.

## Experiment conventions

- Name: `exp{NNN}_{change}`. Create with `just new-exp <name> <base>`; the docstring keeps `base:`.
- Write the hypothesis in the docstring and in the Issue before writing code.
- All tunables live in the `Config` dataclass; `tyro` turns them into CLI flags
  (`--model-params.n-estimators 500`). Nested dataclasses, not dicts.
- Run ids: no overrides -> `default`; `--debug` -> `debug`; otherwise a hash of the overrides;
  `--run name` to choose. Same overrides reuse the same directory.
- Always `just run <exp> --debug` before a full run. Full runs go to the background.
- `infer.py` imports only what the Kaggle image provides plus `kgl` and its own `run.py`. It must
  produce the same `submission.csv` locally (`just infer`) and in the kernel.
- Components are named in `Config` and resolved with `kgl.registry` (`"lightgbm.LGBMClassifier"`,
  registered feature functions). Prefer adding a name over adding a branch.

## Validation

- Folds come from `folds/<name>.parquet`; `Config.folds` pins the version. A new design gets a new
  file, and `docs/validation.md` records why.
- Match the split to how the test set was built (time, group, stratified). See the
  `kaggle-validation` skill.
- Before trusting a new CV or making a first submission, run the `leak-reviewer` agent and save its
  report under `docs/reviews/`.

## Trackers and secrets

- `metrics.json` is the record. `Config.tracker` selects `none`, `wandb`, or `mlflow`
  (`kgl.tracker`); trackers are for curves, not for the record.
- Secrets stay in `.env` (gitignored) and `~/.kaggle/`. Never print `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN`, W&B keys, or
  the contents of `~/.kaggle/`.
